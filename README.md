# Software-Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was Artemis Financial.  Artemis Financial’s desire to modernize its operations and as a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface and is seeking Global Rain’s expertise in taking steps to protect their client data and financial information. 

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Based on the requirements and what the code and the dependieces for example this one used the spring framework. For this compnay they are working with alot of personal information with there clients so there infomration needs to be secured to help to protect their clients Information and vice versa. The value of the software security helps to keep the code up to date. As well as being as secure as possible. In turn this helps for them to be able to keep clients as they can trust their infomration not getting out. If this company could not be trusted then they would not have any companies. So in order for them to succed this is a very important step in that direction.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Based on the companies needs I determied what kind of security would need to be implmeneted. I then did reseach on the algorthims to determine what would be the best fit of the needs of the company.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I did this by one seeing if there were any issues running the code properly. Then I ran a dependency check before implmenting something new and then implmenting and then ruuning it again to be able to determine if there was anything that was new that was added. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  What of the tools that I will useing Maven and doing a dependency check. In future assignments this can help to see any Vulnerabilities within my oen code. As this was my first time working with the pom.xml file I found it to be very useful. Also implementing secuirty measures on my data. I might acutally work on doing this to some of my personal files as they display alot of my personal infomration as this is my VA (military) paperwork that I have stored but not necessarily secured.  
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

  For this I am showcasing both my projects from this course. I am doing this until I have more experience and better projects to be able to base it off of. Both projects showcased something completely different. One dealt with looking at the code and what the company was looking for and finding out what levels of security is needed as well as where some of the vulerabilites would lie within the code just by doing a static review. While the second project implmented a cipher algortherm as well as a hash function to be able to secure the data. As well as showed that I was able to run a dependency check to see the vulerabilites on the cureect dependeiences as well as suppressing false postives as there are some issues that you have to deal with at times. These both showed different skills that I learned. Also I am just starting out my portfolio so this give them a couple of different skills for me to be able to display.
